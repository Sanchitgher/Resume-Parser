# Resume-Parser using NER

• This work proposes a machine learning technique to parse resumes using spacy and transformer, two sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) frameworks
• Python language was used because of its wide range of libraries. Spacy was used for NLP task such as tokenization, text categorization
• The use of NER and Roberta transformer using Spacy, with a very potent combination of NLP and ML, was used in this project for both installation and training as well as to extract the entities from resumes
• This git repository contains the dataset file as train_data.pkl, requirement.txt and a notebook file as
Resume_parser.ipynb which has all training and testing code for the development of the proposed model and
system. It also has a deployment folder named as APP which has the HTML files, app.py file, NamedEntity.py
along with my trained model.
How to run the code:
• Python 3.7 or higher with pip must be installed.
• Download the generated model My_trained_model_61
• Install the requirement.txt file which can be found in git repository on command line using “pip install -
r requirements.txt”
• Run the app.py in command line using “python app.py” which will run the app.
